Jump to a declaration in Go source code. Replacement for godef.

Does not handle name conflicts files correctly yet.
Eg. strings.Compare and mylib.Compare will conflict. gotodef will return whichever is imported first.

TODO:
	goto local variable declarations
	goto struct members

Usage:
	gotodef <expr> <file>

Output:
	<file>:<line>:<col>

Vim Integration:
Put this in your .vimrc:
	function! GotoDef()
	  echo "gotodef " . expand("<cword>") . " " . expand('%:p')
	  let loc = system("gotodef " . expand("<cword>") . " " . expand('%:p'))
	  if loc == ""
		echo "no decl found"
		return
	  endif
	  let args = split(loc, ":")
	  execute "edit " . args[0]
	  execute "cal cursor(" . args[1] . ", " . args[2] . ")"
	endfunction
