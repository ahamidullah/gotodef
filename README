Jump to a declaration in Go source code. Replacement for godef.
Does not handle name conflicts/cgo files correctly yet.

Usage:
	gotodef <expr> <file>

Output:
	<file>:<line>:<col>

Vim Integration:
Put this in your .vimrc:
	function! GotoDef()
	  echo "gotodef " . expand("<cword>") . " " . expand('%:p')
	  let loc = system("gotodef " . expand("<cword>") . " " . expand('%:p'))
	  if loc == ""
		echo "no decl found"
		return
	  endif
	  let args = split(loc, ":")
	  execute "edit " . args[0]
	  execute "cal cursor(" . args[1] . ", " . args[2] . ")"
	endfunction
